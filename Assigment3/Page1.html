				<p>1. A little about myself. I am currently 19 years old and was on March 16th 1996. I was born in S. Korea and was adopted at a very young age. I have grown up in Brooklyn most of my life and enjoy NYC very much. I attended Storm King School in upstate New York for my entire high school carrier. I also went to American University for a year but had to leave due to complications. I am now a part time student at New York Code + Design Academy and work part time at a new start up app called Fleek. </p>

				<p> I will fill up the rest of these pages soon but for now i will copy and paste the same paragraphs to fill out the website and learn how to display layout.</p>
