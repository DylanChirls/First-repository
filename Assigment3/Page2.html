				<h2>U.S. Agrees With Russia on Rules in Syrian Sky</h2>
				<p>MOSCOW — Russia and the United States signed an agreement Tuesday that regulates all aircraft and drone flights over Syria, the defense departments of both countries announced.</p>
				<p>At a Pentagon briefing, Peter Cook, the department’s press secretary, said the agreement, called a memorandum of understanding, established safety protocols requiring the Russians and the United States-led international coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria to maintain professional airmanship at all times, use specific communication frequencies and establish a communication line on the ground.	 </p>
				<p>Anatoly I. Antonov, the Russian deputy defense minister, said in a Defense Ministry statement, “The memorandum contains a set of rules and restrictions aimed at preventing incidents between the Russian and U.S. aviation.” He did not go into details, but said it had “important practical significance.”</p>
				<p>The coalition has been bombing Islamic State positions in Syria since September 2014, so American officials were alarmed when Russia, with little warning, began launching its own airstrikes in Syria on behalf of its ally three weeks ago. Russia made no effort to coordinate the strikes with American air operations in the region, the United States has said.</p>
				<p>There have been several close calls. On two occasions, Russian aircraft flew within 1,500 feet and 500 feet of American warplanes, although not in a threatening manner. Such incidents underscore the need for such an agreement, Mr. Cook said.</p>
				<p>“The Russians need to abide by these flight safety protocols that they’ve now agreed to, because we don’t want miscalculation and misunderstanding,” he said.</p>
				<p>The protocols call for aircraft to maintain a “safe distance” from one another, said Mr. Cook, refusing to elaborate on what that distance is but saying coalition air crews know how close is too close. “There’s no need for them to have an encounter if everyone’s abiding by these rules,” he said.</p>
				<p>The text of the memo was not released. Mr. Cook said the Russians had requested that it not be shared. He declined to elaborate on the ground communication line, including where exactly it would be located, but described it as a backup resource to “have real-time conversations” in case something went wrong with the air communications.</p>
				<p>Mr. Antonov suggested that more concrete steps needed to be hammered out, including round-the-clock communications channels that would be established between the two relevant military commands and cooperation on issues like joint assistance in “critical situations.”</p>

				<h2>Paul Ryan Says He Would Serve as Speaker if Republicans Unite</h2>
				<p>WASHINGTON — Representative Paul D. Ryan said Tuesday that he would be willing to serve as speaker if all the factions of his party could unite behind him, giving hope to House Republicans who have been divided by conflict and confusion.</p>
				<p>In what were at times pointed remarks in a private session with his colleagues, Mr. Ryan called for changes both to the way the speaker’s job is structured — focused more on communicating the party’s message and less on fund-raising — and for an end to the antics of “bomb throwers and hand wringers,” according to members in the room.</p>
				<p>“We have become the problem,” Mr. Ryan said in a news conference afterward. “If my colleagues entrust me to be the speaker, I want us to become the solution.”</p>
				<p>He suggested that he wanted an answer by Friday.</p>
				<p>Mr. Ryan made it clear that he would not accede to preconditions set by “one group,” a clear reference to the members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, which helped push Speaker John A. Boehner into retirement. Now it may be those same hard-liners who are feeling pressure to fall in line behind Mr. Ryan.</p>
				<p>By demonstrating a willingness to serve but with the caveat of essentially unconditional acceptance, Mr. Ryan appeared to be playing a rather canny card. Instead of begging for support, he more or less dared members not to give it, leaving them the option of rejecting him and trying to find another willing candidate while explaining to the party — and perhaps the nation — why Mr. Ryan was not a viable choice.</p>

				<h2>$9.8 Billion Valuation for Ferrari</h2>
				<p>For years, car fanatics have dreamed of owning a Ferrari. Now they can own at least a piece of the company.</p>
				<p>The sports car manufacturer priced its initial public offering on Tuesday at $52 a share, the top end of an expected price range, raising more than $894 million for its corporate parent, Fiat Chrysler. The stock sale values the racecar specialist at about $9.8 billion.</p>
				<p>Ferrari begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning under — what else? — the ticker symbol RACE, at a tough time for European automakers. Weeks earlier, shares of its parent and those of other European automakers sagged for a time in the wake of the diesel emissions cheating scandal at Volkswagen.</p>
				<p>It will also triumphantly enter a stock market that has proved trying for many other market debutants.</p>
				<p>First Data, the huge credit card processor, faltered in its initial offering last week as it priced below an expected price range. The stock price of Pure Storage, a highly recommended data storage provider, slumped in its first day of trading, though its shares eventually recovered. And Albertsons, the big supermarket chain, has postponed its I.P.O.</p>
				<p>Ferrari, of course, is not a payments company or a Silicon Valley start-up or a grocery chain. It is one of the most venerated names in high-end sports cars, having drawn the affection of car aficionados for decades. (The company’s road shows for potential investors drew capacity crowds in cities like New York and London, according to reports.)
